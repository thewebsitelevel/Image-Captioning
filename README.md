# Deep Neural Networks
**Deep learning** (also known as **deep structured learning**) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.

### Definition
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

## Convolutional Neural Network
**Convolutional Neural Networks** are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks from the previous chapter: they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.

So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.

# Keras

**You have just found Keras.**

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

  * Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
  * Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
  * Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

## ResNet50

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/1210/1*3ND8w0xwiK3sOYLllGaQVw.png "Revolution of Depth")


ResNet, short for Residual Networks is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks. This model was the winner of ImageNet challenge in 2015. The fundamental breakthrough with ResNet was it allowed us to train extremely deep neural networks with 150+layers successfully. Prior to ResNet training very deep neural networks was difficult due to the problem of vanishing gradients.
AlexNet, the winner of ImageNet 2012 and the model that apparently kick started the focus on deep learning had only 8 convolutional layers, the VGG network had 19 and Inception or GoogleNet had 22 layers and ResNet 152 had 152 layers. In this blog we will code a ResNet-50 that is a smaller version of ResNet 152 and frequently used as a starting point for transfer learning.

## LSTM
Recurrent Neural Networks suffer from short-term memory. If a sequence is long enough, they’ll have a hard time carrying information from earlier time steps to later ones. So if you are trying to process a paragraph of text to do predictions, RNN’s may leave out important information from the beginning.
During back propagation, recurrent neural networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. Gradients are values used to update a neural networks weights. The vanishing gradient problem is when the gradient shrinks as it back propagates through time. If a gradient value becomes extremely small, it doesn’t contribute too much learning.

So in recurrent neural networks, layers that get a small gradient update stops learning. Those are usually the earlier layers. So because these layers don’t learn, RNN’s can forget what it seen in longer sequences, thus having a short-term memory. If you want to know more about the mechanics of recurrent neural networks in general, you can read my previous post here.

**LSTM’s and GRU’s as a solution**
LSTM ’s and GRU’s were created as the solution to short-term memory. They have internal mechanisms called gates that can regulate the flow of information.

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yBXV9o5q7L_CvY7quJt3WQ.png)

These gates can learn which data in a sequence is important to keep or throw away. By doing that, it can pass relevant information down the long chain of sequences to make predictions. Almost all state of the art results based on recurrent neural networks are achieved with these two networks. LSTM’s and GRU’s can be found in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text generation. You can even use them to generate captions for videos.

# Flask
Flask (source code) is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy.

![alt text](https://www.fullstackpython.com/img/logos/flask.jpg)

Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in common situations the equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.

**Install Flask from PyPI (recommended):**
Note: These installation steps assume that you are on a Linux or Mac environment. If you are on Windows, you will need to remove sudo to run the commands below.
```
   $ sudo pip3 install flask
```

If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:

```
   $ pip3 install flask
```
# How To Run?
In the terminal run the following snippet of code.
```
   $ python3 app.py
```
app.py is the main file to host the local server
